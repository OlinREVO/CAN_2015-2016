# CAN Nodes and API 2015-2016
This repository contains all the CAN programming for the 2015-2016 school year.

## Usage

To make and flash an ATmega with a certain Node's code (the most common operation), use the following:

```
$ sudo make FILE={name} flash
```

Note that {name} should be the filename of the \*.c code you wish to flash without the .c attached. For example:

```
$ sudo make FILE=blinky flash
```

## TODO
Make more nodes
